      <h1>👩‍🍳 Hi, we're <span>Anshu & Mitali</span>!</h1>
      <p>
        Two friends with one big love – <b>FOOD</b>.<br><br>
        We started this recipe page because cooking for us is not just about taste, it’s about 
        <span>memories, fun, and creativity</span>.<br><br>
        Here, you’ll find everything from <b>quick 10-minute snacks</b> to soulful traditional dishes. 
        Sometimes we experiment, sometimes we keep it classic – but always with a pinch of 
        <span>love and laughter</span>.<br><br>
        Our goal is simple: to make cooking <b>easy, joyful, and delicious</b> for everyone.<br><br>
        Thank you for being part of our kitchen journey 💛<br>
        Let’s cook, share, and eat together! <span class="emoji">🥘✨</span>
